# RestApi-Jwt
A simple web API with Authentication and Authorization... Created for testing,
This project was created solely for testing. Most of the methods here can be written in seperate classes.

No External data source was used, just static list found in Mockdata class containing two users(admin/client)

Please check the Mockdata class for login details to test end-point

On our program class, ValidateIssuer was set to false because we dont want to validate our jwt issuer key just yet.

Also Note that two end points was created for both users (Admin / Other Clients)
